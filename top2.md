> Continuation of [MATH 6210](top1). Topics covered will be homology, cohomology and some applications. 

### Prelim exam syllabus

- singular homology
- the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms
- homology group of spheres
- the degree of a map between spheres
- homology calculations via CW complexes
- proof of homotopy invariance
- proof of excision
- universal coefficient 
- Kunneth Theorem

### Textbooks

- Topology and Geometry, by Glen E. Bredon
- An Introduction to Algebraic Topology, by Joseph J. Rotman
- Algebraic Topology, A. Hatcher
- A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology, J. Peter May

### Problem sets

From the [syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bPOnqftRnfLxF4UrC44a1NZQMoZHE0tF/view):

> Problems sets will be posted to a restricted dropbox and discussed in class during a problem session, which will be approximately every two weeks. We will cover as many problems as we can during problem sessions. For a problem: 
> 
> - One student will be chosen to present the solution in class and lead the discussion on that problem.
> - A different student will be chosen to write-up the solution (typeset using LATEX). Solutions (.tex and .pdf files) are due via email by 1 pm the day of the class following the problem session.
>
> Tentative dates for the problem sessions: Jan 30, Feb 13, Feb 27, Mar 13, Apr 3, Apr 17, and possibly May 1.
