title: "HOWTO: Submit Homework in Exceptional Circumstances"

I have three requirements if you are submitting homework to me in exceptional circumstances.

1. Please let me know if you have an exceptional circumstance **before** the homework deadline. 

    - I.e., email me either well ahead of time or *as soon as it becomes apparent* that you have an exceptional circumstance.

2. Please **label the header** of your assignment with

    - the *assignment number*,
    - your *section number*, and
    - your *full name*.

3. When you are actually submitting your assignment, please either

    - email me a **single PDF file** that contains a *legible* version of your assignment, or 
    - slide a **hard-copy** of your assignment under the door of MATH 201 (last door on the west corridor of the  2nd floor of the Math Building).

## Advice for creating PDFs

This regards requirement 3. The easiest method is certainly to use a scanner at the library. But there are some other methods.
