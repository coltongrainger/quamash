Here are scattered notes I've compiled to keep pace with lectures. As of 2019-02-02 they are no longer updated, because at that time I began collecting notes on an iPad. The exposition matches that "As apeares in the wast booke", in the sense of

> A rough account-book in which entries are made of all transactions at the time of their occurrence, to be posted afterwards into the more formal books of the set. [OED v4, entry for "waste-book"]

## Epigram

From Act 4. Scene 4.1, in [Volpone; Or, The Fox](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4039/pg4039.txt), by Ben Jonson:

> PER: Pray you let's see, sir. What is here? <br>
> [READS.] <br>
> "Notandum, <br>
> A rat had gnawn my spur-leathers; notwithstanding, <br>
> I put on new, and did go forth: but first <br>
> I threw three beans over the threshold. Item, <br>
> I went and bought two tooth-picks, whereof one <br>
> I burst immediatly, in a discourse <br>
> With a Dutch merchant, 'bout ragion del stato. <br>
> From him I went and paid a moccinigo, <br>
> For piecing my silk stockings; by the way <br>
> I cheapen'd sprats; and at St. Mark's I urined." <br>
> 'Faith, these are politic notes! <br>
> 
> SIR P: Sir, I do slip <br>
> No action of my life, but thus I quote it. <br>
> 
> PER: Believe me, it is wise! <br>
> 
> SIR P: Nay, sir, read forth.
