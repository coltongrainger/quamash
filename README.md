## Welcome

This wiki consolidates my notes and a partial bibliography.

I aim to prepare content while I am preparing for my preliminary exams (in mathematics) at CU Boulder. Some passages may be intolerably raw,^[For example, I have a [parsing script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coltongrainger/dotfiles/master/.local/bin/scripts/mnep.sh) to format lines beginning with `CAPS!` into $\LaTeX$ [front-back cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coltongrainger/dotfiles/master/.config/mnemosyne/config.py) for mnemosyne.] but are eventually meant to be *cooked and et*.
