Presently, however, the exposition is "As apeares in the wast booke", i.e., 

```
PER: Pray you let's see, sir. What is here?

    [READS.]

    "Notandum,
    A rat had gnawn my spur-leathers; notwithstanding,
    I put on new, and did go forth: but first
    I threw three beans over the threshold. Item,
    I went and bought two tooth-picks, whereof one
    I burst immediatly, in a discourse
    With a Dutch merchant, 'bout ragion del stato.
    From him I went and paid a moccinigo,
    For piecing my silk stockings; by the way
    I cheapen'd sprats; and at St. Mark's I urined."

    'Faith, these are politic notes!

SIR P: Sir, I do slip
    No action of my life, but thus I quote it.

PER: Believe me, it is wise!

SIR P: Nay, sir, read forth.
