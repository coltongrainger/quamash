(Mirrors UChicago's 151-152-153 sequence?)

MAT-151   CALCULUS I 
4 CREDITS 
Prerequisites: MAT-149 or equivalent course with 
a minimum grade of C. 
A study of differential and integral calculus of real 
functions of one real variable. Topics include limits 
and continuity, differentiation, the chain rule, the 
mean-value theorem, the fundamental theorem of 
calculus, curve sketching, integration by 
substitution, introductory differential equations , and 
applications of the derivative and integral. 

MAT-152   CALCULUS II
4 CREDITS
Prerequisites: MAT-151 or equivalent course with
a minimum grade of C.
MAT-152 is a continuation of MAT-151. A further
study of differential and integral calculus of real
functions of one real variable. Topics include further
techniques of integration, applications of the
integral (volume, arc length, work), and sequences
and series.

MAT-251   CALCULUS III
4 CREDITS
Prerequisites: MAT-152 or equivalent course with
a minimum grade of C.
A continuation of MAT-152. A study of real
functions of several real variables. Topics include
differentiability and continuity, differential geometry,
extrema, Lagrange multipliers, multiple integration,
line and surface integrals, and the theorems of
Green, Gauss and Stokes.

## Inquiry based

[“Calculus I: Notes and Problems by Stallmann, Cornelius”](http://jiblm.org//downloads/dlitem.php?id=103&category=jiblmjournal). *Journal of Inquiry-Based Learning in Mathematics*. Retrieved August 17, 2018. “This problem sequence is intended for an inquiry based first semester course in calculus. It introduces the student to differentiation using simple motion and tangent line examples. Differentiation rules are developed by the student. Optimization is investigated. The student discovers integration and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus through area explorations. Initial value problems are investigated as applications of anti-differentiation. The calculus of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions as well as some of their applications are introduced. Basic anti-differentiation rules and techniques are discovered by the student. Some version of these notes was used by the author for ten semesters from 2002 through 2011 at Augusta State University (now Georgia Regents University).”

Retrieved August 17, 2018. “These notes constitute a self-contained sequence for teaching, using an inquiry-based pedagogy, most of the traditional topics of Calculus I, II, & III in classes of up to 40 students. The goal of the course is to have students constantly working on the problems and presenting their attempts in class every day, supplemented by appropriate guidance and input from the instructor.”

Retrieved August 17, 2018. “These notes are designed for use in a 15-week, 4-credit-hour differential calculus course with students from both mathematics and the sciences. While a strong background in algebra is of course preferred, few assumptions about student knowledge of trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions are made. All preliminary concepts are thoroughly defined throughout the chapters, and the development of these definitions are meant to be an integral part of their use within differential calculus.”
