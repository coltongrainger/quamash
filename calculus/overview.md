Update for 2018--19

> MAT-150 Applied Calculus: A Modeling Approach
> 
> An introductory course in differential and integral calculus, useful for work in the natural sciences and the social sciences, with a strong emphasis on developing scientific computing and mathematical modeling skills. Topics may include functions of one or more variables, differentiation, integration, and applications, including an early exposure to differential equations and initial value problems, some introductory vector analysis and linear algebra, and techniques of estimation. This course is designed to be suitable both for students with no prior experience of calculus and for students with some AP calculus experience. 
> 
> MAT-175 Single Variable Calculus
> 
> This calculus course studies the theory of differentiation and integration of functions of one variable. Main topics include functions, limits, differentiation, and integration. Topics may include continuity, Riemann sums, the fundamental theorem of calculus, techniques of integration, improper integrals, L'Hopital's rule, geometric series, power series, and Taylor series. This is a more mathematically rigorous course than MAT-150. Students planning further work in mathematics or physics and who have successfully completed a previous calculus course are encouraged to take MAT-175.
> 
> MAT-275 Multivariable Calculus
> 
> This course is an extension of calculus to higher-dimensional spaces. Main topics include differentiation of functions of two and three variables, an introduction to vector analysis and parametrization, and a study of definite integration in both rectangular and curved coordinate systems. Topics may include a review of functions of several variables, vector geometry of 3-dimensional space, partial derivatives, gradient vectors, optimization techniques, multiple integration in the three classical curvilinear coordinate systems, parametric equations, vector fields, line integrals and Green's Theorem, and the other classical integral theorems of differential geometry.

## Inquiry based instructor's notes

[“Calculus I: Notes and Problems by Stallmann, Cornelius”](http://jiblm.org//downloads/dlitem.php?id=103&category=jiblmjournal). *Journal of Inquiry-Based Learning in Mathematics*. Retrieved August 17, 2018. “This problem sequence is intended for an inquiry based first semester course in calculus. It introduces the student to differentiation using simple motion and tangent line examples. Differentiation rules are developed by the student. Optimization is investigated. The student discovers integration and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus through area explorations. Initial value problems are investigated as applications of anti-differentiation. The calculus of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions as well as some of their applications are introduced. Basic anti-differentiation rules and techniques are discovered by the student. Some version of these notes was used by the author for ten semesters from 2002 through 2011 at Augusta State University (now Georgia Regents University).”

Ted”](http://jiblm.org//downloads/dlitem.php?id=100&category=jiblmjournal). *Journal of Inquiry-Based Learning in Mathematics*. Retrieved August 17, 2018. “These notes constitute a self-contained sequence for teaching, using an inquiry-based pedagogy, most of the traditional topics of Calculus I, II, & III in classes of up to 40 students. The goal of the course is to have students constantly working on the problems and presenting their attempts in class every day, supplemented by appropriate guidance and input from the instructor.”

Retrieved August 17, 2018. “These notes are designed for use in a 15-week, 4-credit-hour differential calculus course with students from both mathematics and the sciences. While a strong background in algebra is of course preferred, few assumptions about student knowledge of trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions are made. All preliminary concepts are thoroughly defined throughout the chapters, and the development of these definitions are meant to be an integral part of their use within differential calculus.”
