> Thursday projects: The recitation is every Thursday and is supervised by a graduate Teaching Assistant (TA) and an undergraduate Learning Assistant (LA). In recitation you will work on projects in small groups with several of your classmates. Expect to be assigned to groups, which will be changed frequently. The TA and LA will be present during recitations to facilitate your work on the projects, but the goal is for you (and your group-mates) to work through, and complete these projects on your own as much as possible. Your LA and TA will be making sure that you participate in your group’s explorations and discoveries. Your grade is partially based on participation, so participate. Missed projects cannot be made up: if you miss a Thursday recitation, you will receive a zero for that project. However your lowest two recitation grades will be dropped.

> Written homework: You will be assigned several conceptual problems each week. These problems are a variety of problems from the textbook, along with supplement problems. You are expected to write up complete, legible, and logical solutions to these problems, which will be graded by your Teaching Assistant. Each problem should be written using complete sentences to explain your steps. You may work together on homework to understand the problems and even to solve them (in fact, we recommend it). However, when you write up your solutions, this should be done independently, and in your own words. Thus it is your own language and your own work. If you are wondering if you crossed the line, ask yourself “Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look like this?” If not, then you are submitting someone else’s work (plagiarism). Copying homework solutions from the internet also constitutes plagiarism. All cases of plagiarized homework will be submitted to the Honor Code Board. Homework will be collected in and returned in Thursday recitations. Late homework will not be accepted, but your lowest two homework scores will be dropped. Your homework must be stapled and labeled with your section number to be counted for credit.

>  Written homework is due once a week, on Thursdays, at the start of your recitation section. In these problems you should show all of your work in complete mathematical "sentences", writing complete English sentences when you explain your logic. You should expect some homework problems to be more challenging than what you might see in WebAssign or on exams. Here are guidelines for how to write your homework. Please always staple your homework and label it with your section number. Late homework will not be accepted.
