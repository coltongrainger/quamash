Do take a look at [homework 6 solutions](https://github.com/coltongrainger/fy19ta/raw/master/2019-02-28-davenport-solutions.pdf) (from Hunter Davenport).

Here's the examinable material in Stewart's Calculus and Contexts (4e). (If you haven't already, it's not too hard to find a `.pdf` of the textbook online. Hint: read the wikipedia entry on [Library Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis).)

> 2.7 The Derivative of a Function
> 2.8 What does $f'$ say about $f$?
> 3.1 Derivatives of Polynomials
> 3.1 Derivatives of Exponential Functions
> 3.2 Product and Quotient Rules
> 3.3 Derivatives of Trig Funtions
> 3.4 The Chain Rule
> 3.5 Implicit Differentiation
> 4.1 Related Rates

Here's material that is non-examinable.

3.6 Inverse Trigonometric Functions and Their Derivatives
3.7 Derivatives of Logarithmic Functions
3.8 Rates of Change in the Natural and Social Sciences
3.9 Linear Approximations and Differentials

## What is recitation?

- "The repetition of a prepared lesson or exercise; an examination on something previously learned or explained." (OED 2nd ed.)
- "A safe space in which asking questions for clarification on big ideas, their applications, and specific problems is encouraged." <https://uaap.mit.edu/tutoring-support/study-tips/maximizing-lectures-recitation/optimizing-recitations>
- "Work on projects in small groups with several of your classmates." <https://math.colorado.edu/math1300/1300projects.html>

## How is recitation graded?

Thursday recitations account for 15% of the total grade in MATH 1300.

assessment | portion of total grade
--- | ---
written homework  | 10%
participation | 5%

### Written homework 

**TL;DR:** You will be graded on your mathematical writing. You need to turn in your assignment at the *start* of recitation.

Here are Lee Roberson's goals for the written homework:

> - You will be assigned several conceptual problems each week, [which will be due on Thursdays to your Teaching Assistant.]
> - You are expected to write up complete, legible, and logical solutions to these problems.
> - Each problem should be written using complete sentences to explain your steps.
> - You may work together on homework to understand the problems and even to solve them (in fact, we recommend it).
> - However, when you write up your solutions, this should be done independently, and in your own words. If you are wondering if you crossed the line, ask yourself “Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look like this?” If not, then you are submitting someone else’s work.
> - Late homework will not be accepted, but your lowest two homework scores will be dropped.

This is my policy on collaboration:

>  If you collaborate with other students, cite that on your homework submission. If you get help at office hours, cite that on your homework submission. If you get help from outside Internet sources, cite that on your homework submission.

Here is a warning from [Dave Rosoff](https://github.com/daverosoff/Math352ModelCourse/blob/master/M352_S2013_syllabus.tex) to complete the *entire* assignment.

> I will assign more [than twice] as much homework as I will grade. You might decide this means that if you don't do most of it, I will never know. This is true in at most a limited sense: when the exam comes, I will probably find out whether you have been completing the homework or not.
>
> My goal is as follows: Every student who successfully completes all of the homework problems and *understands all the solutions* should be able to earn an A in this course. The exams are designed with this in mind. Therefore, I hope you will agree that it is in your very best interest to complete all of the assigned work, regardless of whether it is graded for credit.

### Student evaluations

Here are select comments from my Fall 2018 evaluations. Following the example set by [Kate Stange](https://math.colorado.edu/~kstange/evals-brown-comments.html) I have included negative comments and tried to give a representative cross-section.

MATH 1300 (023)  | 27  | 20  | 74.07%
MATH 1300 (880)  | 15  | 13  | 86.67%

> - Colton challenged our knowledge in this class to a very beneficial degree and I don't think any other could replicate that.
> - I appreciate the enthusiasm and love for calculus that you bring into the classroom. You're always willing to politely help out students with questions, and you have the knowledge to give them thorough answers. I realize this is a college course, but your grading also tends to be tough (more applicable at the beginning of the semester, I believe), which can be frustrating when the work is correct but the style is a little off. You're probably preparing us for the test though, which is a fair reason! 
> - Please call on students less in class, I don't think any of us enjoy the surprise, even when we know the material. Having volunteers write their answers up on the chalkboard is a decent way to get the entire class involved though (if you don't put them on the spot)!
> - I did not feel the attendance quizzes were helpful, they were beyond the scope and level of this class and did not serve much purpose for me.

<!--
- During the period of recitation, I was challenged by my TA and was answering questions that pushed my limits of how I think about calculus. Any questions I had were answered during this period.
- I appreciate your support to this subject. 
- colton is good in class and knows the material. at times it seems like he's afraid to approach us, we're all human!
- A little bit nervous in front of students. That is comforting to know as a student because there is no superiority complex or power roles. Thus, when he teaches, a student can see him as totally equal.

**Negative.**

- I thought the quizzes for the attendance were so challenging and conceptual that I never knew how to begin answering them and ended up guessing every time. Even though we got the answers I would have learned a lot more if the questions were easier and more relevant to the course.
- Knows the material well, sometimes overcomplicates explanations, be more firm about asking people to come up and explain or asking the LA to do something
- Explained the content very thoroughly with lots of detail. Sometimes his explanations were too intricate and was hard to understand as a student. He is very well knowledged on the content, however.
- way too many terms we didn’t understand which is the worst way possible to teach concepts that are already difficult. Please dumb it down
- I am left more confused each time after I talk to Mr. Grainger
- I did not feel the attendance quizzes were helpful, they were beyond the scope and level of this class and did not serve much purpose for me.
- Dishonest and unfair

## Epigram

Calculus is the canonical entry to undergraduate mathematics. *We all want you to win.* From Richard Hamming (talk at Bellcore, 7 March 1986):

> *Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!*
