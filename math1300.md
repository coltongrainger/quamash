Calculus is the canonical entry to undergraduate mathematics. *We all want you to win.* From Richard Hamming (talk at Bellcore, 7 March 1986):

> *Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!*

## Assignments

### [WebAssign](https://www.webassign.net/colorado/login.html)

For repetition testing with immediate feedback.[^K]

> It is your responsibility to make sure you complete each [WebAssign] assignment by the posted due date. These due dates are shown in WebAssign, and are also posted on the schedule page of this website. Assignments are due at 11:59 pm [mountain time] on the due date.

### Problem sets

To build fluency in reasoning and writing.

> You will be assigned several conceptual problems each week. These problems are a variety of problems from the textbook, along with supplement problems. You are expected to write up complete, legible, and logical solutions to these problems, which will be graded by your Teaching Assistant. Each problem should be written using complete sentences to explain your steps. You may work together on homework to understand the problems and even to solve them (in fact, we recommend it). However, when you write up your solutions, this should be done independently, and in your own words. Thus it is your own language and your own work. If you are wondering if you crossed the line, ask yourself “Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look like this?” If not, then you are submitting someone else’s work (plagiarism). Copying homework solutions from the internet also constitutes plagiarism. All cases of plagiarized homework will be submitted to the Honor Code Board. Homework will be collected in and returned in Thursday recitations. Late homework will not be accepted, but your lowest two homework scores will be dropped. Your homework must be stapled and labeled with your section number to be counted for credit.

> Many years ago Mary-Claire was a frequent passenger on the Chicago bus system. The neighborhood where she boarded her #5 bus was a gathering spot for "bummy guys" ... Some begged, others peddled. Among the peddlers---hawking wares ranging from trenchcoats full of watches to freedom from the peddler's presence---was a man whom May-Claire patronized quite regularly. He sold pencil stubs (obviously collected from trash bins); but Mary-Claire said his patter was charming enough to rate one or two pencils a week.

### [Recitation projects](https://math.colorado.edu/math1300/1300projects.html)

To practice collaborative problem solving.

> The recitation is every Thursday and is supervised by a graduate Teaching Assistant (TA) and an undergraduate Learning Assistant (LA). In recitation you will work on projects in small groups with several of your classmates. Expect to be assigned to groups, which will be changed frequently. The TA and LA will be present during recitations to facilitate your work on the projects, but the goal is for you (and your group-mates) to work through, and complete these projects on your own as much as possible. Your LA and TA will be making sure that you participate in your group’s explorations and discoveries. Your grade is partially based on participation, so participate. Missed projects cannot be made up: if you miss a Thursday recitation, you will receive a zero for that project. However your lowest two recitation grades will be dropped.

[^K]: **Completion of assignments in WebAssign is required for this course**, however:

    [WebWork](http://webwork.maa.org/index.html) is a compelling open source alternative; if one feels like bemoaning the course coordinator, one's efforts would be best directed in *politely* proposing a curriculum change for *next year's* students.

## Qualitative reviews

To paraphrase [Kate Stange](http://math.colorado.edu/~kstange/evals-brown-comments.html):

> I have given a selection of comments from departmental student evaluations (FCQs at CU Boulder).  It is departmental policy to make these anonymous comments available after course grades have been submitted.  I have included negative comments also (at the end), and tried to give a representative cross-section of both (as well as preserving the ratio), while reducing repetition.

- Colton challenged our knowledge in this class to a very beneficial degree and I don't think any other could replicate that.
- Colton Grainger was a great TA for recitation! Super enthusiastic about math and it was easy to see he loves what he's doing. Thank you for a great semester!
- I appreciate your support to this subject. 
- I appreciate the enthusiasm and love for calculus that you bring into the classroom. You're always willing to politely help out students with questions, and you have the knowledge to give them thorough answers. I realize this is a college course, but your grading also tends to be tough (more applicable at the beginning of the semester, I believe), which can be frustrating when the work is correct but the style is a little off. You're probably preparing us for the test though, which is a fair reason! 
- During the period of recitation, I was challenged by my TA and was answering questions that pushed my limits of how I think about calculus. Any questions I had were answered during this period.
- colton is good in class and knows the material. at times it seems like he's afraid to approach us, we're all human!
- A little bit nervous in front of students. That is comforting to know as a student because there is no superiority complex or power roles. Thus, when he teaches, a student can see him as totally equal.

#### Negative 

- Knows the material well, sometimes overcomplicates explanations, be more firm about asking people to come up and explain or asking the LA to do something
- Please call on students less in class, I don't think any of us enjoy the surprise, even when we know the material. Having volunteers write their answers up on the chalkboard is a decent way to get the entire class involved though (if you don't put them on the spot)!
- Explained the content very thoroughly with lots of detail. Sometimes his explanations were too intricate and was hard to understand as a student. He is very well knowledged on the content, however.
- way too many terms we didn’t understand which is the worst way possible to teach concepts that are already difficult. Please dumb it down
- I am left more confused each time after I talk to Mr. Grainger
- I thought the quizzes for the attendance were so challenging and conceptual that I never knew how to begin answering them and ended up guessing every time. Even though we got the answers I would have learned a lot more if the questions were easier and more relevant to the course.
- I did not feel the attendance quizzes were helpful, they were beyond the scope and level of this class and did not serve much purpose for me.
- Dishonest and unfair
