## What is recitation?

- "The repetition of a prepared lesson or exercise; an examination on something previously learned or explained." (OED 2nd ed.)
- "A safe space in which asking questions for clarification on big ideas, their applications, and specific problems is encouraged." <http://uaap.mit.edu/tutoring-support/study-tips/maximizing-lectures-recitation/optimizing-recitations>
- "Work on projects in small groups with several of your classmates." <https://math.colorado.edu/math1300/1300projects.html>

## How is recitation graded?

Thursday recitations over the semester account for 15% of the total grade in MATH 1300:

assessment | portion of total grade
--- | ---
written homework  | 10%
participation | 5%

### Written homework rubric

TLDR; You will be graded on your *mathematical writing.*

> You will be assigned several conceptual problems each week. These problems are a variety of problems from the textbook, along with supplement problems. You are expected to write up complete, legible, and logical solutions to these problems, which will be graded by your Teaching Assistant. Each problem should be written using complete sentences to explain your steps. You may work together on homework to understand the problems and even to solve them (in fact, we recommend it). However, when you write up your solutions, this should be done independently, and in your own words. Thus it is your own language and your own work. If you are wondering if you crossed the line, ask yourself “Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look like this?” If not, then you are submitting someone else’s work (plagiarism). Copying homework solutions from the internet also constitutes plagiarism. All cases of plagiarized homework will be submitted to the Honor Code Board. Homework will be collected in and returned in Thursday recitations. Late homework will not be accepted, but your lowest two homework scores will be dropped. Your homework must be stapled and labeled with your section number to be counted for credit.

### Participation rubric

TLDR; You will be graded on your ability to give your peers *constructive oral feedback.*

## Information about the TA

### A typical class

- After preliminary remarks, I subdivide the class into peer groups of 4--5 students.
- I task each group to come to a consensus on a set of scaffolded arguments that makes rigorous either the example or the theory introduced in the preliminary remarks.
- I ask each group to select a representative to present and justify a particular step in the derivation, at which time the class is expected to ask constructive questions.
- I give a summary overview, and class ends with an exit quiz.

### Evaluations

To paraphrase [Kate Stange](http://math.colorado.edu/~kstange/evals-brown-comments.html): Here's a selection of comments from my previous student evaluations.  It is departmental policy to make these anonymous comments available after course grades have been submitted.  I have included negative comments also (at the end), and tried to give a representative cross-section of both (as well as preserving the ratio), while reducing repetition.

Fall 2018 Sections | Enrolled Students  | Responded Students  | Response Rates
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
MATH 1300 (008)  | 25  | 21  | 84%
MATH 1300 (023)  | 27  | 20  | 74.07%
MATH 1300 (880)  | 15  | 13  | 86.67%
Overall  | 67  | 54  | 80.6%

#### Positive

- Colton challenged our knowledge in this class to a very beneficial degree and I don't think any other could replicate that.
- Colton Grainger was a great TA for recitation! Super enthusiastic about math and it was easy to see he loves what he's doing. Thank you for a great semester!
- I appreciate your support to this subject. 
- I appreciate the enthusiasm and love for calculus that you bring into the classroom. You're always willing to politely help out students with questions, and you have the knowledge to give them thorough answers. I realize this is a college course, but your grading also tends to be tough (more applicable at the beginning of the semester, I believe), which can be frustrating when the work is correct but the style is a little off. You're probably preparing us for the test though, which is a fair reason! 
- During the period of recitation, I was challenged by my TA and was answering questions that pushed my limits of how I think about calculus. Any questions I had were answered during this period.
- colton is good in class and knows the material. at times it seems like he's afraid to approach us, we're all human!
- A little bit nervous in front of students. That is comforting to know as a student because there is no superiority complex or power roles. Thus, when he teaches, a student can see him as totally equal.

#### Negative 

- Knows the material well, sometimes overcomplicates explanations, be more firm about asking people to come up and explain or asking the LA to do something
- Please call on students less in class, I don't think any of us enjoy the surprise, even when we know the material. Having volunteers write their answers up on the chalkboard is a decent way to get the entire class involved though (if you don't put them on the spot)!
- Explained the content very thoroughly with lots of detail. Sometimes his explanations were too intricate and was hard to understand as a student. He is very well knowledged on the content, however.
- way too many terms we didn’t understand which is the worst way possible to teach concepts that are already difficult. Please dumb it down
- I am left more confused each time after I talk to Mr. Grainger
- I thought the quizzes for the attendance were so challenging and conceptual that I never knew how to begin answering them and ended up guessing every time. Even though we got the answers I would have learned a lot more if the questions were easier and more relevant to the course.
- I did not feel the attendance quizzes were helpful, they were beyond the scope and level of this class and did not serve much purpose for me.
- Dishonest and unfair
