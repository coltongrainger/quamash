Then $p(k) = 0$. The Remainder theorem states \[ p(x) = q(x) \cdot (x-k) + p(k)\] and substitution implies\[p(x) =q(x) \cdot (x-k) + 0.\] So $x-k$ is a factor of $p(x)$. Conversely, suppose$x-k$ is a factor of $p(x)$. Then\[p(x) =q(x) \cdot (x-k).\] I claim $x=k$ satisfies $p(x) = 0$.

Then \[b^{y_1} = a \text{ and } a^{y_2} = x.\] Substitution of $b^{y_1}$ for $a$ yields \[x = (b^{y_1})^{y_2} = b^{y_1y_2}.\]Because logarithms are exponents, $y_1y_2 = \log_b(x)$.
