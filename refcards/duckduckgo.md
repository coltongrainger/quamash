ACL Anthology | !acl | [“What is the ACL and what is Computational Linguistics? ACL Member Portal”](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/what-is-cl). “The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the premier international scientific and professional society for people working on computational problems involving human language, a field often referred to as either computational linguistics or natural language processing (NLP). The association was founded in 1962, originally named the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics (AMTCL), and became the ACL in 1968. Activities of the ACL include the holding of an annual meeting each summer and the sponsoring of the journal Computational Linguistics, published by MIT Press; this conference and journal are the leading publications of the field. For more information, see: https://www.aclweb.org/.”

These books lent their name to the company he founded in 2003.After working for four years as a bond trader for D. E. Shaw & Co., Rusczyk created the Art of Problem Solving web site, which provides resources for middle and high school students to develop their mathematics and problem solving abilities. These include real-time competitions to solve math problems and on-line tools to learn how to solve problems with increasing difficulty as well as math forums. Rusczyk has also published the Art of Problem Solving series of books aimed at a similar audience. The site also provides fee-based online mathematics classes, which range from Prealgebra to Group Theory and Calculus.”

Both editions continue to sell briskly and are widely cited inthe scientific literature. However, with the many advances in the theory, computation and application of special functions that have occurred since 1960, a new standard reference is badly needed. NIST intends to satisfy this need by providing a Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) as a free Web site together with an associated book and CD-ROM.”

The Complexity Zoo | !cz |  [“Complexity Zoo Introduction - Complexity Zoo”](https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Zoo_Intro). “The sprawling web of known relations among complexity classes - containments, oracle separations, random oracle separations, lowness results, the occasional inequality - is not fixed in my memory like the English language. And so it's largely for my own benefit that I recorded a chunk of what's known in one unwieldy HTML file.The second audience is other theorists and theory students, who might find the Zoo to have a few advantages as a reference. First, inspired by Eric Weisstein's famed World of Mathematics, it links liberally between entries. Second, it can be updated regularly - much of its current content is not yet in any book as far as I know. Third, it takes a democratic approach to complexity classes, with big hitters like NP listed alongside the lesser-known mAL, PODN, and QACC0. Any class is fair game so long as something nontrivial has been said about it in the literature.”
