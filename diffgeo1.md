## Syllabus for MATH 6230 (Introduction to Differential Geometry)

Instructor: [Prof. Jeanne Clelland](http://math.colorado.edu/~jnc/)

### Prerequisites

From John Lee's [Math 442 Differential Geometry](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lee/Courses/442-2013/syllabus.pdf) syllabus:

> - Vector calculus: partial derivatives, the chain rule, dot products, cross products, tangent lines, tangent planes, line integrals, surface integrals, gradients, vector fields, the divergence theorem.
> - Linear algebra: vector spaces, bases and dimension, linear maps and their representation by matrices, rank of a matrix, determinants, matrix algebra, eigenvectors and eigenvalues. 
> - Analysis in several variables: functions of several variables and their differentials; the inverse and implicit function theorems; the change of variables theorem for double and triple integrals.
> - Topology: open and closed sets, boundaries, limit points, closures, continuous maps, homeomorphisms, connected sets, compact sets. 

From Lee's [Math 554](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lee/Courses/544-2006/syllabus.pdf) syllabus, for a study of *topological manifolds*:

> - Set Theory : Operations on sets, functions, equivalence and order relations, number systems and cardinality, the axiom of choice. References : Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin, Chapter 1; Mathematical Analysis by Apostol, Chapters 1 and 2; Appendix to [ITM]. 
> - Analysis : Metric spaces; convergence and continuity; open and closed sets; interior, exterior, and boundary; compactness. Reference : Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin, Chapters 2,3,4; Mathematical Analysis by Apostol, Chapters 3 and 4; Appendix to [ITM].

> - Linear algebra : Abstract vector spaces, subspaces, bases, dimension, matrices, determinants, change of basis formulas, linear maps, kernel and image, norms and inner products, orthonor- mal bases. Reference : any rigorous linear algebra text, such as Linear Algebra by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence; Appendix to [ISM].
> - Multivariable  calculus : Partial derivatives; the total derivative as a linear approximation; Taylor’s formula in several variables; multiple integrals and the change of variables formula; gradient, divergence, and curl; the theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes; uniform conver- gence. References : Basic  Multivariable  Calculus by Marsden, Tromba, and Weinstein; Principles of  Mathematical  Analysis by Rudin, Chapters 5,6,7; Mathematical  Analysis by Apostol, Chapters 12–14; Appendix to [ISM].
> - Differential  equations : Basic facts about existence and uniqueness of solutions to ODEs; elementary techniques for solving first-order equations and systems at the level of Math 307 and 309. Reference : Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems by Boyce and DiPrima.
