### Week 0

Course with [Richard Green](https://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/). Git repo for assignments: <http://github.com/coltongrainger/fy19alg2>. 

Changes I hope to make in contrast with the [algebra 1](alg1) notes:

- more
    - reflection
    - narrative
    - references
- less
    - mathjax bloat
    - rote memorization
    - agony
