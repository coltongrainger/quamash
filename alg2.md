## MATH 6140 Syllabus 

Instructor: [Dr. Richard Green](https://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/)

Website: <https://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/6140/>

Git repo: <http://github.com/coltongrainger/fy19alg2>. 

Here're the changes I hope to make in contrast with my Algebra 1 notes.

- More: discussion, reflection, narration, and reference. 
- Less: mathjax bloat, rote memorization, agony.

### Prerequisites

Here are exams from Algebra 1, Fall 2017, the last time Dr. Green instructed: [ring theory](http://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/6130/p6130f.pdf), [further topics group theory](http://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/6130/p6130b.pdf), and [basic group theory](http://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/6130/p6130a.pdf).

I talked a bit with Dr. Thiem about preparing for modules, field theory, Galois theory, etc. Our consensus: one must *know* linear algebra. (One can never know enough linear algebra!) 

The [undergraduate handbook](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/undergrad/ughandbook/year3/ma377/) for MA337 the University of Warwick suggests:

> MA106 Linear Algebra, familiarity with elementary group theory and the ring theory part of MA249 Algebra II: Groups and Rings is desirable.
