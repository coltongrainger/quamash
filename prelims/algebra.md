EX! The Ur monoid on a non-trivial set $S$ is ... the set of transformations of $S$ into itself, with composition of functions as the binary operation.

EX! The Ur group on a non-trivial set $T$ is ... the set of automorphisms $\mathrm{Sym}(T)= \{ \text{all bijections } $\sigma \colon T \to T$ \}$, with composition of functions as the binary operation.

EX! $\GLnR$ is a subgroup, properly contained in ... $Sym(\RR^n)$.

> You cannot learn too much linear algebra!

EX! What is the order of the permutation group on $n$ letters? ... $S_n$ is a finite group with order $n!$.

> I recommend you never write out multiplication tables when reasoning throught the problem will do.

FACT! The multiplication table of an Abelian group with $n$ elements is (what type of matrix)? ... symmetric.

EX! What's the matrical subgroup of $GL_2(\RR)$ that stabilizes the line $y=0$? ... $H = \left\{ \pmatrix{a & b \\ 0 & d} : ad \neq 0 \}$, since the first basis vector is taken to a scalar multiple of itself!

PROP! The subgroups of $(\ZZ, +)$ are precisely given by ... $(b\ZZ, +)$, where $b$ is a fixed integer.

PROOF! Show that $(b\ZZ, +)$ for any fixed integer $b$ is a subgroup of $(\ZZ,+)$. ... It's closed: $bm + bn = b(m+n)$; inverses exist: $-bm = -b(m)$; the identity is $b0 =0$. 

PROOF! Show that the $(b\ZZ, +)$ for $b \in \ZZ$ exhaust the subgroups of $(\ZZ, +)$. [...] In this latter case, $H$ has $m \neq 0$ and inverses exist, so $H$ has a least positive integer $b > 0$. Then $H \supset b\ZZ$ by closure under addition and inversion. Suppose $h \in H$. Then $h = mb + r$ by the Euclidean algorithm, and $m \in \ZZ$, $0 \leq r < b$. I claim $r=0$. Why? $r = h - mb \in H$ and $r < b$, but $b$ is the least positive element. So $H \subset b\ZZ$. ... If $H$ is a subgroup of $\ZZ$, either $H = \{0\}$ (a subgroup) or $H$ is non-empty.

THM! The subgroup of $\ZZ$ of the form $$\{ a\ZZ + b\ZZ \} = \{ n \in \ZZ : n = ar + bs \text{ for } r,s \in \ZZ\}$$ is generated by $d$, where $d$ is ... the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$.

PROP! Let $a,b \in \ZZ$ both not zero and let $d$ be the positive integer that generates the subgroup $a\ZZ + b\ZZ$. Why can $d$ be written as $ar + bs \text{ for } r,s \in \ZZ$? ... Because $d \in a\ZZ + b\ZZ$.

PROP! Let $a,b \in \ZZ$ both not zero and let $d$ be the positive integer that generates the subgroup $a\ZZ + b\ZZ$. Why does $d$ divide $a$ and $d$? ... Because $a \in d\ZZ$ and $b \in d\ZZ$.

PROP! Let $a,b \in \ZZ$ both not zero and let $d$ be the positive integer that generates the subgroup $a\ZZ + b\ZZ$. Why, if $k$ divides $a$ and $b$, does $k$ also divide $d$? ... Because $a, b \in k\ZZ$, and under closure $ar + bs \in k\ZZ$, alas, $d$ has this form, so $k$ divides $d$.
